<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
<p><em>Guardian Angel </em>is a crowdfunded medical aid web application. There will be two types of users. Donners and donation seekers. A user can be both at the same time. Donners will be able to know the person seeking help on a personal level. After a successful recovery, dinners will be able to see a follow up on those who survived. Users will also see those, who plead for help and perished. This will instill a sense of accomplishment in the dinners. Our intention is to help those who are from developing nations or underdeveloped nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
<p>Users, who are unable to pay for treatments that are life-threatening, impose imminent danger, will be able to sign up to our site. Then they can post for help. This will be limited so minimize spam posts and profile. We might ask for all the documents to be notarized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to sign up, it will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Valid email address/ cellphone number</li>
</ul>
<p>Help post will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>NID photo (guardians for children)</li>
<li>Doctor&rsquo;s prescription</li>
<li>Past treatments</li>
<li>Medical History</li>
<li>Notarized Medical Certificates</li>
<li>Personal photos (as many as the user wants)</li>
<li>A brief description (5000 characters)</li>
<li>An essay (optional)</li>
<li>Contact information (number/address/social medias etc.)</li>
<li>Amount of funds needed</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The homepage will show a list of helpful posts. This is not final, but the idea is to show the oldest-not-helped-children. Oldest as in posted how long ago. Each Help post will provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary picture</li>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Short bio</li>
<li>Disease</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be a search bar at the top. Users can search for anything, for example, name, country, age, disease, etc.</p>
<p>Users can view all the necessary information related to a particular post by clicking on it. On top and bottom, there will be a Donate button. Clicking that button will directly take the user to the payment page. There the user will fill in the necessary payment information and make the donation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Users can know more by visiting a Help post</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Donators will be notified when a Help post reaches its goal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Via email/ text</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All saved and unsaved lives will be displayed on the home page.</p>
<p>Users can bookmark a Help post. No limit on how many can be bookmarked.</p>
<p>Initially, users can contact each other through other third-party applications. We hope to change this in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong></p>
<p>Front end: We will use HTML and CSS to design the frontend. All static pages of our web application will be made using HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Back end: We will use python for the backend. We will turn our static pages into dynamic and functional pages using python.</p>
<p>Database: We will use MySQL for the database.</p>
<p>Framework: We will use Django as a framework. This shortens the development time. And also keep things organized.</p>
<p>Payment gateway: We will use Stripe API for payments. We will be able to use this in our test case. The authentication key will determine whether the request is live data or a test case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social impact:</strong></p>
<p>Bangladesh is slowly growing as a medium-income country. Our lives have drastically changed in the past thirty years. The Internet had brought forth globalization, and globalization had brought forth prosperity. Yet still, there is a very long way to go. Universal Healthcare is still a foreign concept to us. All of our lives would be dramatically different if we did not have to worry about our medical bills and the medical bills of our family members. Diseases, falling ill, these are a part of every single life on this blue planet. What makes us different is that we, as a species can cure most of the deadly diseases, or vaccinate against it. And those that we cannot cure or prevent now, we will do it in the future! But healing is not free. Everything has a price. Not everyone is able to pay that price. In the western world, most countries have Universal Healthcare or some sort of medical aid. We are not there yet. John F. Kennedy said in his inauguration speech, &ldquo;Ask not what your country can do for you &ndash; ask what you can do for your country.&rdquo; We must help ourselves first, we need to be helped first.</p>
<p>Now I have to be told about this, emotion sells, and emotion sells like a hot cake when it is on the internet. We see medical help posts on social media every day. And people do help. But most of the time the help comes within the country, by some good Samaritan. But what if people of the first world could directly come to the aid of the rest of the world? Enter, &ldquo;Guardian Angel&rdquo; our web application. We will directly connect individuals to one another on a personal level. When you help a child or an adult with a new life on a personal level, that will surely mean something to you. You can sleep easy at night, knowing there is at least one life that has been saved by your intervention, Devine or not!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Monetization:</strong></p>
<p>Initially, we will keep a small portion from the donations to cover the cost of the operations to keep the service running. We will in the meantime, actively seek investors. When we will have generated revenue, we will reinvest it into mass marketing to the western audience. Or people who have the excess wealth to help.</p>
<p>Our main goal will always be to help those who are doomed. But we will also have to make sure that we do not doom ourselves in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Future ambitions:</strong></p>
<p>Our main goal will be to minimize suffering. Households that might not have survived financially, help them to prosper. In the future, we wish to include chat, voice chat, video chat so that both parties can form a bond of some sort. We wish to implement Google Translate API to translate texts to the user&rsquo;s native language.</p>
<p>We all might have helped a hundred strangers, but this time we will help someone we have got to know. Right now, we lack many skills and knowledge. <em>Guardian Angel</em> will not be built in a day.</p>
